# Salesforce_Developer_LWC

I am a Salesforce Developer.
I like to improve myself every day step by step.
The documents here are for the Salesforce LWC project. 
It consists of the codes I wrote for the lightning web components that I developed as a result of my various researches. 
Html, css, javascript, xml files were used.
